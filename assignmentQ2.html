             ==>The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function.
            ==>var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.*/

            ==>Here, greeting is globally scoped because it exists outside a function while hello is function scoped. So we cannot access the variable hello outside of a function.
            ==>if in case if we try to access hello outside the function we will get an error as hello is not available outside the function*/

            ==>A variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block.*/

            ==>let can be updated but not re-declared.

            /*----const----
            ==>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
            ==>const declarations are block scoped
            ==>Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
            ==>const cannot be updated or re-declared.
            This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared*/
            
            //if we declare a variable with const, we cannot do this:

            const greeting = "say Hi";
            const greeting = "say Hello instead";// we get an error as greeting has already been declared
            
            //Every const declaration therefore, must be initialized at the time of declaration it self.


            /*so on overall the differences are:
            ==>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
            ==>var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
            ==>They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
            ==>var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
