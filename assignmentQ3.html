      /*There are six basic data types in JavaScript
      ==> they are divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types.
            --> String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. 
            --> Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. -->Undefined and Null are special data types.*/
        

        /*The String Data Type
            ==>The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). 
            ==>Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters*/
            var a = 'Hi there!';  // using single quotes
            var b = "Hi there!";  // using double quotes


        /*The Number Data Type
            ==>The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation
            ==>The Number data type also includes some special values which are: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN. Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity âˆž, which is greater than any number. Infinity is the result of dividing a nonzero number by 0.
            ==>While NaN represents a special Not-a-Number value. It is a result of an invalid or an undefined mathematical operation, like taking the square root of -1 or dividing 0 by 0, etc.*/
            var a = 25;         // integer
            var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
            var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
            var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425
            console.log(16 / 0);  // Output: Infinity
            console.log(-16 / 0); // Output: -Infinity
            console.log(16 / -0); // Output: -Infinity
            console.log("Some text" / 2);       // Output: NaN
            console.log("Some text" / 2 + 10);  // Output: NaN
            console.log(Math.sqrt(-1));         // Output: NaN


            /*The Boolean Data Type
            ==>The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc.*/

            var a = 2, b = 5, c = 10;
 
            console.log(b > a) // Output: true
            console.log(b > c) // Output: false


            /*The Undefined Data Type
            ==>The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.*/
            var a;
            var b = "Hello World!"
 
            console.log(a) // Output: undefined
            console.log(b) // Output: Hello World!

            /*The Null Data Type
            ==>This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. 
            ==>A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.*/
            var a = null;
            console.log(a); // Output: null
 
            var b = "Hello World!"
            console.log(b); // Output: Hello World!
 
            b = null;
            console.log(b) // Output: null


            /*The Object Data Type
            ==>The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.

            ==>An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.*/

            var emptyObject = {};
            var person = {"name": "Clark", "surname": "Kent", "age": "36"};

            var car = {
                    "modal": "BMW X3",
                    "color": "white",
                    "doors": 5
                    }

            /*The Array Data Type
            ==>An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. 
            ==>Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index.
            ==> it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. 
            ==>The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].*/
            var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
            var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
 
            console.log(colors[0]);   // Output: Red
            console.log(cities[2]);   // Output: New York


            /*The Function Data Type
            ==>The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables*/

            var greeting = function(){ 
            return "Hello World!"; 
            }
 
            // Check the type of greeting variable
            alert(typeof greeting) // Output: function
            alert(greeting());     // Output: Hello World!
